        Welcome To The Tailwind CSS Masterclass, Here you'll learn everything there is to know about tailwind css, doesn't matter if you're a total beginner or advanced developer, or even if you're coming from the bootstrap background, I still got you. This comprehensive guide will teach you everything from the beginning, ill also provides a timestamp for those who are not new to tailwind css, so that they can either learn new topics or they can jump straight into the projects. This is a fun project-based course to learn how to create awesome layouts using the Tailwind CSS framework and get comfortable using utility classes over something like Bootstrap, which uses component-based classes.

        What Is Tailwind CSS?
        Tailwind CSS is an open-source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables, but instead it will give you the superpower of customization, Which I covered in a very great depth in this course.
        
        Is Tailwind CSS better than Bootstrap?
        If you're not a designer and just want to put together a quick and easy UI for people to use, then Bootstrap might be the way to go. But, if you want complete freedom with your design and the ability to create custom designs and components easily then Tailwind CSS is the better choice.
        
        Now the question is "Do big companies use Tailwind CSS" ?
        Well, that's a valid point, 368 companies reportedly use Tailwind CSS in their tech stacks, including MAK IT, Superchat, and Ã¼berdosis.
        
        The best time for learning Tailwind CSS was a year ago, BUT the second best time is to learn it "RIGHT NOW" without any questions, that's it.
